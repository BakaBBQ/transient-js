##Original Works
###All works should be (to a certain extent) original
Self explainatory. Use your common sense to judge one work's originality

###All works should be legally perfect
That means if your work is based on someone else's, you must follow the original author's terms

###Be productive
That also translates to "do small projects frequently" instead of toiling for months on a big project without achieving anything

###Try new things every time
Encourages you to acquire new skills every time

##Others
###All internationalized doujin activities are encouraged
So if you feel like playing hisoutensoku with Americans, then go for it
